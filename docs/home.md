# Orbit â€“ The Open Source Family Hub

*One central screen. Every family detail.*

Orbit is a touchscreen-based, open-source family hub designed to replace whiteboards, scattered phone apps, and sticky notes. Built for wall-mounted tablets, it brings together calendars, lists, chores, routines, and more, with gamification to make family life fun and functional.
