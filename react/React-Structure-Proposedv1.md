# Orbit React Native Project – File Structure Guide

This guide walks through every significant file and directory in the repository so that new team members can navigate the codebase with confidence.

---

## 1. Project Overview

At a glance the project is divided into two layers:

1. **Tooling and configuration** at the root. These files control the build, linting, TypeScript, Expo runtime, and editor behaviour.
2. **Application source** inside the `src` directory. Here you will find feature‐level code, shared UI, assets, and supporting utilities.

A simplified tree is included below. Paths that begin with a dot (`.`) are hidden by default on most systems.

```
├── .expo/            ← Expo runtime cache and device info
├── .vscode/          ← Workspace‑scoped editor settings
├── src/              ← First‑class application code
├── app.json          ← Expo & native app configuration
├── package.json      ← Dependency manifest and npm scripts
└── tsconfig.json     ← TypeScript compiler options
```

## 2. Hidden Directories

### `.expo/`

* **Purpose** – Keeps local metadata that the Expo CLI needs during development. It stores simulator definitions, asset caches, and type helpers. Nothing here is committed to your production build.
* **Key paths**

  * `devices.json` – remembers which simulators you opened last.
  * `types/router.d.ts` – ambient types generated by Expo Router.

### `.vscode/`

* **Purpose** – Repository‑specific Visual Studio Code settings. Ensures a consistent development environment for linting, formatting, and auto‑imports.
* `settings.json` adjusts TypeScript SDK paths and React Native quick fixes.

---

## 3. Root‑Level Configuration Files

* **`README.md`** – High level project description and onboarding steps.
* **`.gitignore`** – Lists files that Git should ignore, such as build artefacts and system caches.
* **`app.json`** – Central Expo configuration. It defines the app name, icons, splash screens, and native permissions.
* **`eslint.config.js`** – Lint rules that keep the style guide consistent.
* **`expo-env.d.ts`** – Extends TypeScript so it recognises global Expo types.
* **`package.json` / `package-lock.json`** – Dependency list, npm scripts, lockfile for reproducible installs.
* **`printTree.js`** – Utility script that prints the directory tree you see above.
* **`tsconfig.json`** – Compiler options such as strictness, path aliases, and JSX transform settings.

---

## 4. `src/` – Application Source

Every folder in `src` has a single responsibility and can be imported via path aliases (for example `@components/HelloWave`).

### 4.1 Routing: `src/app/`

* Mirrors the URL structure defined by **Expo Router**.
* `(_layout).tsx` files act like layouts in web frameworks. They wrap all nested screens so you can define shared headers and tab bars once.
* `(tabs)/` holds the bottom tab navigator. Each file inside represents one tab screen such as **Home** (`index.tsx`) or **Explore** (`explore.tsx`).
* `+not-found.tsx` renders when a user navigates to an unknown path.

### 4.2 Assets: `src/assets/`

* **Fonts** – Custom typefaces are registered here then loaded in the root layout.
* **Images** – App icons, branding, illustrations, and splash screens. Images are imported with the React Native packager so they are optimised at build time.

### 4.3 Shared Components: `src/components/`

Reusable UI building blocks that stay presentation‑focused.

* Top‑level files (`Collapsible.tsx`, `ParallaxScrollView.tsx`, etc.) are cross‑platform abstractions.
* The `ui/` subfolder holds platform specific variants. For example `IconSymbol.ios.tsx` overrides behaviour on iOS while `IconSymbol.tsx` is the default for Android and web.

### 4.4 Constants: `src/constants/`

Single source of truth for colours, spacing, and any static values that should never change at runtime.

### 4.5 Context: `src/context/`

React **Context** providers that expose global state such as authentication or theme preferences.

### 4.6 Features: `src/features/`

Domain driven modules. Each folder encapsulates everything required for one feature slice.

* **calendar** – Calendaring logic, views, and state.
* **chores** – Task scheduling and gamification engine.
* **lists** – Shopping, to‑do, and custom lists.
* **notes** – Sticky notes and quick memos.

Every feature should follow the “slices” convention: local state, sub‑components, and service calls live together so the module can evolve independently.

### 4.7 Hooks: `src/hooks/`

Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable behaviour, for example adaptive colour schemes or debounced storage writes.

### 4.8 Business Logic: `src/logic/`

Pure TypeScript functions that implement core calculations and data transformations. Kept framework‑agnostic so they can be unit tested in isolation.

### 4.9 Scripts: `src/scripts/`

One‑off developer tools. `reset-project.js` clears node modules, caches, and the Expo bundle to fix broken local environments.

### 4.10 Services: `src/services/`

Wrappers for external APIs or device capabilities. Examples include local database helpers, notifications, and network requests.

### 4.11 Utilities: `src/utils/`

Small helper functions that do not belong to a single feature. If a util grows feature specific, migrate it to the relevant slice.

---

## 5. How to Extend the Structure

* **Add a new feature** – create a sibling folder inside `src/features/` and colocate its screens, sub‑components, and state management.
* **Add new routes** – place a new `.tsx` file in `src/app/`, or nest it inside a directory that matches the desired path segment.
* **Share code** – Prefer extracting to `src/components/` or `src/hooks/` instead of reaching across feature boundaries.

## 6. Recap

This layout keeps concerns separated, scales with new functionality, and plays well with the Expo tooling pipeline. When in doubt place code where its intent is obvious to a future developer.
